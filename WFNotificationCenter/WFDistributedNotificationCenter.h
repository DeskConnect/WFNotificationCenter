/**
 `WFDistributedNotificationCenter` is a notification center that works within app groups on iOS.
 
 It behaves just like `NSDistributedNotificationCenter`, which in turn behaves just like `NSNotificationCenter`, with the following differences:
 
 - NSNotification `object` properties must be `NSString` objects, if used.
 - All objects in a notification's `userInfo` dictionary must adhere to `NSSecureCoding`.
 - Notifications are always delivered asynchronously, even within the same process
 */

/**
 Initializes and returns a notification center object that can communicate with other notification center objects that share the same `groupIdentifier`.
 
 @param groupIdentifier The application group identifier shared by the code you want to communicate between.
 
 @return The initialized notification center object, or `nil` if the object couldn't be created.
 
 @note Your app must have a `com.apple.security.application-groups` entitlement for the specified application group.
